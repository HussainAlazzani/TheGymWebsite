* Project Overview
In this project, I design and implement a website for a local gym. The website provides information to visitors about the gym; it invites them to join by registering on the website with a verified email, then to select a membership plan and then it processes their payments and activates their membership.

Moreover, the website enables administrators to manage the content of the website and to manage the users by assigning roles and privileges to them, tracking their memberships, issuing bans and removing them from the system. Each member is allocated a personal page where they can view their membership status and their gym activity.
